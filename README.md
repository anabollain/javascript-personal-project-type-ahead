# Type ahead

## Description

The aim of this project is to show the cities and states in the US that match the user's search. 

The interface is very simple:

* Input to filter by city or state name.
* If one or more matches exist, they will appear beneath the input as a list, with the following information: city, state and population.
* If no results are found, a message will indicate so.

## Javascript Used

* querySelector()
* fetch() and promises
* filter()
* map()
* regex expressions
* match()
* join()
* replace()
* innerHTML
* Events

## What I've learned

* To create a regex expression combined with `match()` method to filter an array with the user's input. Up until now I've always used `includes()` and `toLowerCase()` methods to do so. 

* We can either use `ev.target.value` or `this.value` to refer to the value of the element to which the event listener is linked to. 

* To use the `replace()` method.
